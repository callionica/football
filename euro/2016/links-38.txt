Wales star Gareth Bale had, unsurprisingly, been highlighted as the dangerman before the last-16 tie at the Parc des Princes but was largely stifled in a tense all-British affair. However, the Real Madrid man showed his quality with a teasing left-wing cross that the unfortunate McAuley diverted into his own net when sliding to make a clearance with 15 minutes remaining.",
