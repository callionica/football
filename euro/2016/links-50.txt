The opening goal came in first-half stoppage-time through Griezmann's controversial penalty after Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was punished for handling as he attempted to block Patrice Evra's header. Joachim Low's men had the better of the match up until the spot-kick decision, but it posed less of a threat after the break, failing to register a shot on target until injury time as France defended stoutly.",
