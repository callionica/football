Belgium had been placed among the favourites heading into the finals, but put in a disappointing display in their Group E opener, going down 2-0 to Italy. Saturday's performance in Bordeaux was much more akin to what is expected of a side boasting such fine individual talent and a workmanlike Ireland side struggle to cope.",
