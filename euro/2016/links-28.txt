Roy Hodgson made six changes from the side that started the 2-1 win over Wales last time out, but will face criticism after England drew a frustrating blank in Saint-Etienne while Chris Coleman's side thrashed Russia 3-0 to win the group. Jamie Vardy and Daniel Sturridge, the goalscoring heroes against Wales, were given starts, with Wayne Rooney among those rested as Gary Cahill was handed the captain's armband.",

Six changes to his starting line-up was a bold move by the England manager, but it failed to pay off. England dominated this game, but their failure to win ensures they progress to the knock-out stage as runners-up in Group B.",
