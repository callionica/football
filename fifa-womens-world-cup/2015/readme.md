# FIFA Women's World Cup 2015

The public domain data for the 2015 Women's World Cup is quite terse to allow students to analyze and restructure the data. It is a flat array of data for each match with unnamed fields. Unlike the Euro 2016 data, we don't have match reports for this competition, but you can find the final score in the data for each match.
